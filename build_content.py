"""
Regenerate all served content from the input/ source folder.

This is the single command to run after editing anything in input/.
It performs four steps, in order:

  1. Convert input/Glossaire CareSets*.xlsx -> input/ClinicalGlossary.csv
  2. Sync  input/models/  ->  _resources/models/   (the models Jekyll serves)
  3. Generate the glossary CodeSystems from input/*.csv  -> _resources/glossary/
  4. Apply input/glossary_mappings.csv -> element.code in _resources/models/

The workbook is the source for the clinical glossary, so step 1 regenerates
ClinicalGlossary.csv from it. OperationalGlossary.csv has no workbook behind it
and is still edited by hand.

Everything under _resources/ is GENERATED. Never hand-edit it; edit input/.

Usage:
  python build_content.py
